# Instructor Tools

Simple Node.js scripts for instructors to create random student groups and cold call lists.

## Setup
1. Rename `students.template.js` as `students.js`
2. Edit `students.js` with your student names
3. Run: `node makeColdCallList.js` or `node makeGroups.js`

## Files
- `makeColdCallList.js` - Creates randomized list for calling on students
- `makeGroups.js` - Creates random groups (change group size in the file)
- `students.template.js` - Copy this to `students.js` and add your students

Code, comments, and readme improved with assistance from Claude AI.
